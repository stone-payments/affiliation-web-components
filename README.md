# Sling Web Framework
Sling is a open-source framework that makes it easy to build top quality components for high-performance financial applications, made by [Stone Co](https://www.stone.com.br).

The `sling-web-framework` is totally based on vanilla [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction), allowing other projects, both internal and external, to use components without worrying about other frameworks or workflows.
