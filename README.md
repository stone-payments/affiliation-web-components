# Affiliation Web Components

Affiliation-web-components is an open-source library of components that aims to make it easier to display data from the affiliation area in financial applications.

The library was based on [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and made with the [sling-web-framework](https://github.com/stone-payments/sling-web-framework), thus assigning high performance and reuse of components, even in legacy projects.

The affiliation web components are maintained by [Stone Co](https://www.stone.com.br/).
