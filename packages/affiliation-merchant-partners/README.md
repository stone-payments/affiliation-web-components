# Affiliation Merchant Partners Business Component.

This component renders a table element with the merchant information within. It uses table basic component as content wrapper.

## Usage

This is how you set the component into the project html structure.

```html
    <!-- component wrapper page location -->
    <affiliation-merchant-partners
        affiliationCode="">
    </affiliation-merchant-partners>
```

The *affiliationCode* atribute are mandatory for the component to make the correct request to the integrated api and populate it with data.
