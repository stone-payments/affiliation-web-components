# Affiliation Merchant Contacts Business List Component

This component renders a list element with the merchant contacts information inside.

## Usage

This is how you set the component into the project html structure

```html
    <!-- component wrapper page location -->
    <affiliation-merchant-contacts-list
        affiliationCode="">
    </affiliation-merchant-contacts-list>
```

The *affiliationCode* atribute is mandatory for the component to make the correct request to the integrated api and populate it with data.
