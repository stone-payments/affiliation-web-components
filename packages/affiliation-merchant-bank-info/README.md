# Sling Merchant Bank Info Table Component.

This component renders a table element with the merchant bank information within. It uses table basic component as content wrapper.

## Usage

This is how you set the component into the project html structure

```html
    <!-- component wrapper page location -->
    <affiliation-merchant-bank-info
        editable
        affiliationCode="">
    </affiliation-merchant-bank-info>
```

The *affiliationCode* attribute is mandatory for the component to make the correct request to the integrated API and populate it with data.
the *editable* atribute config the component to be editable.
