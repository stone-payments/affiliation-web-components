# Sling Payment Status Business Component.

This component displays icons representing the status of payments.

## Usage
This is how you set the component into the project html structure
```html
    <!--root project index file -->
    <sling-sdk-connect></sling-sdk-connect>

    <!-- component wrapper page location -->
    <sling-payment-status></sling-payment-status>
```
The sibling component *sling-sdk-connect* must be passed in the project root index html file for data management purposes. If the project has multiple business components this must be passed ONLY ONCE.
