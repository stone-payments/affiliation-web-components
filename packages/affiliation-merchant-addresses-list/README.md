# Affiliation Merchant Addresses Business Card Component.

This component renders a card element with the merchant addresses information inside. It uses both card and list basic components as content wrappers.

## Usage

This is how you set the component into the project html structure

```HTML
    <!-- component wrapper page location -->
    <affiliation-merchant-addresses-list
      affiliationCode="">
    </affiliation-merchant-addresses-list>
```

The *affiliationCode* atribute are mandatory for the component to make the correct request to the integrated api and populate it with data.
